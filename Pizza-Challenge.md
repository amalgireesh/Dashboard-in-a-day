# Challenge: Build an agent to order pizza

**Duration**: 3 hours

Complete the Challenge below within the time provided. The challenge is broken up into steps called Levels. Reach Level 7 to complete the Challenge.

## The Challenge

Build a code-first AI Agent that can order pizza using the Azure AI Agent Service. The agent will interpret the user's request and make an order via the provided Pizza API.

In this challenge you will:
- Use the AI Agent Project SDK
- Create an Azure AI Foundry resource 
- Deploy a model
- Write instructions
- Add knowledge to your agent
- Use tools 
- Connect to an MCP Server or API
- Change from text input to visual input
- Use the code interpreter


## Level 1: Interact with Azure AI Foundry

In this first level we will set up Azure AI Foundry and deploy your first model.

### üìãTasks

1. Follow your facilitators instructions to log into  your provided Azure subscription
1. Sign in to Azure AI Foundry at https://ai.azure.com
1. Create an Azure AI Foundry resource for your project
1. Deploy a GPT-4o model for your project
1. Launch the playground for your deployed model
1. OPTIONAL: Share your completion of this level in the #open-hack channel of the [Azure AI Foundry Discord](https://aka.ms/open-hack/discord) (and do this for later levels, too):

### üìö Resources

- [Quickstart: Get started with Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-code?tabs=azure-ai-foundry&pivots=fdp-project)

- [Deploy AI models in Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/openhack/aifoundry)

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

You can interact with your deployed model in the playground.

Your deployed model responds to the prompt "Order me a cheese pizza" with any response.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

If you haven't been provided with an Azure suscription, you can use your own or [sign up for an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account). 

The first thing you will do in Azure AI Foundry is create a Project resource. Give your AI Foundry project a unique name ‚Äî something like `myname-openhack-pizza` will work. 

The AI Foundry Agent can answer your questions about how to achieve tasks. Click the 
<img src="img/foundry-agent.png" alt="AI Foundry Agent" width="20">
icon in the header bar to open the AI Foundry Agent.

An easy way to deploy a model is to find it in the model catalog, and then click the "Use this model" button.

Use the Autodeploy options in the Azure AI Agent Service quickstart to deploy a model and connected resources: [Create an AI Agent with Azure AI Agent Service](https://aka.ms/openhack/aiagentservice)
  

## Level 2: Set up your dev environment and create your first agent

In this level we will configure your development environment and install requirements in the local file system.

### üìãTasks

1. Launch your editing environment of choice, for example:
    - GitHub Codespaces, on this repository
    - Visual Studio Code, on the provided Virtual Machine
    - Visual Studio or another IDE on your own laptop

2. Install the Azure AI Foundry SDK for the language of your choice
1. Connect to Azure AI Foundry
1. Create a basic agent that says hello

### üìö Resources

- [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/quickstart)

- [Install Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/openhack/azurecli)

- [How to use `az login`](https://aka.ms/openhack/azlogin)

- [Quickstart: Create an new agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure)

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent appears in Azure AI Foundry, in the "Agents" tab.

You can launch your agent from the command line and from the Azure AI Foundry Agent Playground.

Your agent responds "hello" to your input.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

Things will be easier if you use GitHub Codespaces, especially for Python developers. If you do, the following tools will be pre-installed for you in the dev container:

  - A recent version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - The [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)
  - A `myagent` folder for sandbox development (this folder will not be tracked by git)

(You'll need to make sure these tools are available to you otherwise.)

Use `az login` to log in to your Azure Subscription via the Azure CLI.

You could ask GitHub Codespaces Agent to "create an agent using Azure AI Foundry SDK that always responds 'Hello' to any input" to get started.

To create your agent from scratch, use either the [Azure AI Foundry Agent Playground](https://aka.ms/openhack/agent-playground) or Azure AI Agent Service code samples in [Python](https://aka.ms/openhack/agent-python-sample) or [.NET](https://aka.ms/openhack/agent-dotnet) to create an AI Agent and confirm the service is properly working.


## Level 3: Add instructions and persistent memory

We will give our first set of instruction to the agent and give it a personality in this level.

### üìãTasks

1. Give the agent a personality suitable for your pizza brand
1. Make sure the agent asks for the customer's name before making an order
1. Instruct the agent to only respond to pizza ordering related questions

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent has your desired personality and can carry on a conversation about pizza. 

Your agent asks your name, and remembers it later in the conversation.

Your agent understands a request to order a pizza (even if it can't actually make an order yet). 

Your agent doesn't attempt to act on non-pizza-related questions.

### üìö Resources

* [Threads, Runs, and Messages in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/threads-runs-messages)

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

If your agent can't remember your name, make sure you are not creating a new thread for each chat  interaction.

You may find you have multiple agents with the same name in AI Foundry. Give your agent a distinctive name (e.g. "Level 3 Pizza Agent") and write code to replace any existing agent by that name to make it easier to keep track.

Can't think of a personality to use? Feel free to adapt the instructions below:

    You are an agent that helps customers order pizzas from Contoso pizza.
    You have a Gen-alpha personality, so you are friendly and helpful, but also a bit cheeky.
    You can provide information about Contoso Pizza and its retail stores.
    You help customers order a pizza of their chosen size, crust, and toppings.
    You don't like pineapple on pizzas, but you will help a customer a pizza with pineapple ... with some snark.
    Make sure you know the customer's name before placing an order on their behalf.
    You can't do anything except help customers order pizzas and give information about Contoso Pizza. You will gently deflect any other questions.

## Level 4: Give your agent knowledge

We will give our agent information about stores the customer can order from.

### üìãTasks

- Make the agent respond to questions about stores, based on the files in the data/store-information folder
- Make sure the agent asks which store to contact before confirming an order

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent can list the available Contoso Pizza stores and answer questions about them.

Your agent about a store location before confirming an order.

### üìö Resources

* Quickstart: [Add files to the agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-code?tabs=python&pivots=fdp-project#add-files-to-the-agent)

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

A tempting solution is to embed the store information in the prompt, but this solution won't scale. Instead, add knowledge to the agent in AI Foundry. This documentation may help: https://ai.azure.com/doc/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/overview

## Level 5: Add a pizza estimation function

We will give our agent the ability to estimate the appropriate amount of pizza to order, if asked.

### üìãTasks

- Add a function to the agent to calculate the amount of pizza needed

### üìö Resources

- [Azure AI Agents function calling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/function-calling?pivots=python)

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent suggests a reasonable amount of pizza given the number of people and their appetite level.

Your agent asks for information about the diners to make that calculation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

Create a simple function in Python or your language of choice that returns the size or amount of pizza needed for a given number of people, and add that function as a tool for the agent.

A large pizza is generally suitable for two adults and two children.


## Level 6: Connect the to the ordering service via the API

We have provided an API for your agent to make orders with Contoso Pizza directly. In this level we will verify the API connection is working before converting to an MCP-based connection in the next level.

### üìãTasks

- Connect the agent to the Pizza API 

### üìö Resources

* [Pizza API](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/pizza-mcp-agents)

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent can successfully retrieve the pizza menu and give information about available toppings.

Your agent can place an order for a pizza, and the order appears on the dashboard in the room.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

For Open Hack events, a Pizza API service has been deployed and is connected to the dashboard showing in the room. Your instructor will provide the endpoint to use.

If you're not at an open hack event, you can deploy the pizza service independently.


## Level 7: Connect to the Pizza MCP Server

Now that you have verified the API connection works, we will connect the agent to an MCP server instead of interfacing with the API directly. This gives Contoso Pizza the ability to add new capabilities to the agent more easily.

Your instructor will give you the URL for the Pizza MCP Server.

### üìãTasks
- Create a Contoso Pizza ID user ID (your instuctor will provide the URL)
- Replace the API integration by and use MCP instead
- Provide the user ID to your agent for use in the System prompt
- Create clear instructions

### üìö Resources

- [Documentation: adding MCP servers to agents in AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/model-context-protocol)

### ‚úÖ Pass Criteria and Requirements

Your agent can take an order for pizza, and it appears on the in-room dashboard.

The AI Agent can provide the status of the customer's pizza order(s).

Your agent can cancel an order after it has been placed, if the cancellation is requested quickly enough.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hints and Tips

For Open Hack events, your instructor will provide the URL of the MCP server to use.

- You can test the MCP server with an existing AI chat UI that supports MCP integration. Some suggestions are: [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/advanced-features/mcp), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) or [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers?view=vs-2022).
