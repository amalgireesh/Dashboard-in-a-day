# Open Hack Challenge: Pizza Agent

Welcome to the Open Hack! This is the place to get started.

Your instructor will give you all the information you need before we start hacking.

## About the Hack Session

During the hack session, you will be given a series of tasks to complete. Each task has a Level, beginning with Level 1.

Each level includes a test that you should confirm you can pass before moving to the next level. The Open Hack works on a trust system, so you don't need anyone to verify you have passed a level before continuing.

If you can get to Level 9 before the time runs out, you have successfully completed the challenge!

## Dev environment and tools

You may use any development environment you like. A good option is to open GitHub Codespaces on this repository, which will provide you with a development environment pre-installed with all of the tools and libraries you need to complete this challenge.

Your instructor will provide you with a prepaid Azure subscription with access to all the services needed to complete this challenge, including Azure AI Foundry. If you prefer, you may use your own Azure subscription, but in that case you will be responsible for any associated costs. 

## Resources to help you

To be successful in this challenge, AI resources are available to help you. You can use any resources you like, but we recommend:

* GitHub Copilot Agent in Visual Studio Code
* Azure AI Foundry Agent

Other resources that may be helpful include:
* Microsoft Learn: https://learn.microsoft.com

## How to get help from a human

When you need the help of a human, experienced proctors are available to help you. Just raise your hand for assistance.

You can also ask questions anytime in the Azure AI Foundry Discord at [aka.ms/open-hack/discord
